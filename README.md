Activity context recognition plays a pivotal role in context-aware computing by enabling systems to automatically determine and infer contextual information from sensor-captured observations. This capability is crucial for developing applications that can dynamically respond and adapt to users' situations, leading to enhanced user experiences and functionalities. As a result, both industry and academia have increasingly focused on advancing context recognition technologies, leading to the rise of various intelligent applications, such as remote health monitoring, lifestyle tracking, and personalized intelligent services.

This project involves the development of an intelligent activity recognition model for a mobile fitness application. The goal is to automatically recognize users' activities using labeled historical activity context data provided by a fitness company. This data was collected from smartphone sensors, including orientation, rotation, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetic, sound, and light sensors.

The dataset consists of low-level sensor data, making it challenging to derive meaningful inferences directly. Therefore, the project employs statistical feature extraction methods to extract valuable information from the raw data, which will be used to train machine learning models for context recognition.

The primary objective of this project is to deliver an activity recognition model for the fitness application, utilizing the activity context tracking dataset. The process includes analyzing, designing, implementing, and evaluating the model using various programming concepts and tools. These include custom module creation, function definitions, object-oriented programming (OOP), file processing, and exception handling. Additionally, scientific computing, data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn are leveraged to achieve the project's goals.
